# FlaskProject

# Math site

1. pip install all flask packages required, running it makes it tell you which ones to install next

2. install mathquill javascript package for math text boxes
you probably need to upload the files to the flask server to be able to load them only for testing locally, but in production you would need to put them onto the other server instead of the flask server (i think)


polyfill is to make your website more accessible to older browsers, talked about in the last video on the playlist above (FCC jQuery series)
